# GraphQL Profile Project - Progress and Next Steps

## What Has Been Done

1. **Project Structure**
   - Basic project structure has been set up with appropriate directories
   - Authentication and GraphQL API modules are in place

2. **Authentication**
   - Login component with username/password form
   - JWT token handling and storage
   - Logout functionality

3. **GraphQL API**
   - API client for making GraphQL requests
   - Token management and authentication

4. **Enhanced Profile Page**
   - Comprehensive user identification display
     - Username, name, email
     - Total XP calculation
     - auditinnnnnng ratio statistics
   - Projects section with statistics
   - Two interactive SVG graph components
   - Responsive design with loading states

5. **Enhanced SVG Graphs**
   - XPGraph component with interactive tooltips, animations, and responsive design
   - AuditGraph component with interactive donut chart, tooltips, and animations
   - Both graphs have proper error handling for missing data

## What Remains To Be Done

1. **Complete User Profile Information**
   - Add more user details beyond just the username
   - Consider adding total XP, grade information, and skills
   - Ensure you have at least three pieces of user information as required

2. **Improve Graph Visualizations**
   - Enhance the SVG graph visuals with better styling
   - Add axis labels and tooltips for better user experience
   - Consider adding animations or interactivity to the graphs

3. **Project Stats Section**
   - Add a dedicated section displaying projects PASS/FAIL ratio
   - Consider adding a third graph visualization for project statistics

4. **Code Organization and Optimization**
   - Review and optimize the GraphQL queries
   - Ensure error handling is consistent throughout the application
   - Add more comprehensive loading states for asynchronous operations

5. **Styling and UI/UX**
   - Add transitions between different states (login vs profile)
   - Consider implementing dark mode
   - Test on different screen sizes

6. **Hosting**
   - Deploy the application to a hosting platform (GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.)
   - Ensure the deployed version works correctly with the API endpoints

7. **Testing**
   - Test the application with different user scenarios
   - Verify all graphs display correctly with different data sets
   - Make sure error states are handled gracefully

## Suggested Next Steps

1. **Immediate Tasks:**
   - Add a dedicated project statistics graph/visualization (perhaps a bar chart showing project grades)
   - Add transitions between login and profile views
   - Complete CSS optimizations for mobile responsiveness

2. **Short-term Tasks:**
   - Deploy the application to a hosting platform (GitHub Pages is recommended)
   - Test the deployed application thoroughly
   - Optimize any performance issues

3. **Final Tasks:**
   - Add final documentation
   - Final testing and bug fixes
   - Submit the project

## Resources

- You have a comprehensive list of GraphQL queries in `queries.txt` - use these to fetch additional data
- The project objective in `objective.md` provides guidance on requirements
- Your authentication system is already working - build on this foundation

Remember that according to the project requirements, you need at least three pieces of information about the user and at least two different statistical graphs using SVG. You've now completed these core requirements!
